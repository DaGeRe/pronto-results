This folder contains, for every project:
deps_$project.json - Static Selected Changes (i.e. Unit Tests where performance may have changed)
execute_$project.json - Trace Induced Changes (i.e. Unit Tests where performance may have changed, selected with higher rigor)
nonChanges_$project.json - Versions without any Change, e.g. because only misc-files have changed and not source files.
nonRunning_$project.json - Versions that were not runnable, e.g. because they were not runnable with OpenJDK 8 or because they relied on SNAPSHOT versions not present anymore
